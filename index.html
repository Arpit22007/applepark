    Apple Park, located in Cupertino, California, is Apple Inc.'s corporate headquarters. Its most notable feature is the circular main building, often referred to as "The Spaceship" due to its futuristic, ring-shaped design. However, the areas outside this iconic circle are just as thoughtfully designed and contribute significantly to the campus.
